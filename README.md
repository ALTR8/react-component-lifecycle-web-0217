# React Component Lifecycle

## Objectives

1. Describe the phases of the React component lifecycle
2. Explain the importance of different phases of the lifecycle

## Overview

This lesson is a very high-level over view of the React component lifecycle. We
want to walk students through the whole shebang.

It might be helpful to break the cycle down into mounting (happens once),
rendering (happens a bazillion times), and unmounting (happens once) phases.

## Suggested metaphors and narratives
I think the use of a 'life and death' metaphor/narrative would work great here. We'll have to make sure we keep things light and friendly though, we don't want to dwell for too long on the more macabre stuff :smile:
